I am a Front End Software Engineer that loves to develop applications that have high impact and reach. My primary skills are in JavaScript and React, with extensive knowledge on semantic html, and vanilla css (including SASS and LESS). Over the course of my career I have built backends using Node JS and express and feel very comfortable utilizing API's on the client side. Most notably I have worked with Twitter's API and implemented O Auth for Twitter on an app; SoMe. You can check out my team's project at https://www.so-me.net/. The past 2 years I have worked on remote, globally distributed teams with high autonomy and great results. Please consider my application and I look forward to discussing how I can be a value add to your team.
