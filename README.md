## About me
I am a Front End Software Engineer that loves to develop applications that have high impact and reach. Currently spend most of my time diving deep into JavaScript, designing applications for accessibility, and staying up to date on the lastest security measures.

Tech Stack:
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- React
- Node.js

## Working On
**Illustrated JS**

Redesigning the way we teach students how to learn Data Structures and Algorithms. Resources for learning these concepts in JS are far and few between and when you find a resource it is riddled with university level engineering and math jargon. Illustrated JS aims to teach students the fundamentals of computer science by illustrating the decision making process and creating examples that resonate with our audience.

**IMBD Movie Finder**

Utilizing the Open Movie DataBase API I was able to create an app that allows you to search for any movie in the database and get access to information such as the title, release date, genre and ratings.

- Search functionality built using custom hooks and context api
- Advanced querys that allow a user to search for a movie and then requery all results to get access to more detailed info
- Built out results pagination so users can access all query matches (only shows 10 movies per page)
